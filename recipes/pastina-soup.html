            <li>1/2 Cup - Carrots</li>
            <li>1/2 Cup - Celery</li>
            <li>4 cups - Broth (Vegetable or Chicken)</li>
            <li>1 tsp - Turmeric</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp - Cayenne Pepper</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Fill a large pot with the water (or ½ water and ½ organic unsalted 
            vegetable broth) and heat over high heat. Add the onion, celery, carrots, 
            and garlic and season with salt. Bring the contents to a boil.</li><br/>
            <li>Once the broth is boiling, reduce the heat to medium-low and semi cover
            the pot with a lid. Let cook for 45 minutes or until the veggies are all
            super soft and the quantity of liquid has reduced. 
            Taste for seasoning and adjust with more salt, if needed.</li><br/>
            <li>Using a slotted spoon, transfer the veggies to a blender, as well as 
            2 ladles full of broth. Blend until the mixture is smooth, 1 to 2 minutes. 
            Return the blended mixture back to the pot of broth and stir.</li><br/>
            <li>Meanwhile, separately boil any pastina of choice in a small pot 
            of salted water.</li><br/>
            <li>Add a ladle of the cooked pastina to the bottom of a bowl, 
            pour the broth on top, and dust with some parm. Enjoy!</li>
